> As a Full-Stack Developer and Product Owner on this project, I strive to be as creatively skilled at design as I am proficient with developing. Building the routes and React architecture, and managing the backlog for such an App will be a challenging but rewarding first experience working with a team, but I am up for it and excited for future ideas and collaborations to be born from this!
